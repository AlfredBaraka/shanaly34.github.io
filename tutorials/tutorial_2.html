            <p>Python provides powerful tools for working with files. Let's explore the essentials of file handling.</p>
            <h2>Importance of File Handling</h2>
            <p>File handling is crucial for reading and writing data to files, which is essential for data storage,
                retrieval, and manipulation in various applications.</p>
            <h2>Disadvantages of File Handling</h2>
            <p>While file handling is useful, it has some limitations, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Limited scalability for large datasets</li>
                <li>No built-in support for advanced data structures</li>
                <li>Potential security risks, such as file injection attacks</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Precautions</h2>
            <p>When working with files, it's essential to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Handle exceptions gracefully to avoid crashing your program</li>
                <li>Close files properly after use to prevent memory leaks</li>
                <li>Sanitize input to mitigate security risks</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Python Code for File Handling</h2>
            <p>Python provides built-in functions to perform various operations on files, including reading, writing,
                and appending data.</p>
            <h3>1. Writing to a File</h3>
            <pre><code>
# Open the file in write mode
with open("my_file.txt", "w") as file:
    # Write three lines of text to the file
    file.write("Hello, world!\n")
    file.write("This is line 2.\n")
    file.write("The answer is 42.\n")
            </code></pre>
            <h3>2. Reading from a File</h3>
            <pre><code>
# Open the file in read mode
with open("my_file.txt", "r") as file:
    # Read the contents of the file
    content = file.read()
    # Display the contents on the console
    print(content)
            </code></pre>
            <h3>3. Appending to a File</h3>
            <pre><code>
# Open the file in append mode
with open("my_file.txt", "a") as file:
    # Append three additional lines of text to the file
    file.write("This is line 4.\n")
    file.write("Appending more text.\n")
    file.write("Last line.\n")
            </code></pre>
            <p class="text-muted">Note: Make sure you have the text file (my_file.txt) when running the code.</p>
