    <section>
        <p>Python provides powerful tools for working with files. Let's explore the essentials of file handling.</p>
        <h2>Importance of File Handling</h2>
        <p>File handling is crucial for reading and writing data to files, which is essential for data storage, retrieval, and manipulation in various applications.</p>
        <h2>Disadvantages of File Handling</h2>
        <p>While file handling is useful, it has some limitations, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Limited scalability for large datasets</li>
            <li>No built-in support for advanced data structures</li>
            <li>Potential security risks, such as file injection attacks</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Precautions</h2>
        <p>When working with files, it's essential to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Handle exceptions gracefully to avoid crashing your program</li>
            <li>Close files properly after use to prevent memory leaks</li>
            <li>Sanitize input to mitigate security risks</li>
        </ul>
       
        <h2>Python Code for File Handling</h2>
    <p>Python provides built-in functions to perform various operations on files, including reading, writing, and appending data.</p>
    <h2 class="solution-description">1. Writing to a File</h2>
    <pre><code>
        # Open the file in write mode
        with open("my_file.txt", "w") as file:
            # Write three lines of text to the file
            file.write("Hello, world!\n")
            file.write("This is line 2.\n")
            file.write("The answer is 42.\n")
    </code></pre>
    <h2 class="solution-description">2. Reading from a File</h2>
    <pre><code>
        # Open the file in read mode
        with open("my_file.txt", "r") as file:
            # Read the contents of the file
            content = file.read()
            # Display the contents on the console
            print(content)
    </code></pre>
    <h2 class="solution-description">3. Appending to a File</h2>
    <pre><code>
        # Open the file in append mode
        with open("my_file.txt", "a") as file:
            # Append three additional lines of text to the file
            file.write("This is line 4.\n")
            file.write("Appending more text.\n")
            file.write("Last line.\n")
    </code></pre>
    <p class="solution-description">#NB: All the time make sure you have that txt file(my_file.txt) when you run code</p>
